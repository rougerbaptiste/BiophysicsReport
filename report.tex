\begin{abstract}
Cryptobiosis is the phenomenon that consists in slowing down the metabolism of an organism in order to extend its life. This phenomenon can be studied in small multicellular organisms that are able to do it : the tardigrads. We studied the time required to set up this state in \textit{Hypsibius dujardini}. We have been able to show that, with an increasing concentration of NaCl, the average time required to observe half of the tardigrads in the cryptobiosis state was decreasing accordingly. Furthermore, we show that the higher the stress, the harder it is to go in cryptobiosis. Study this mecanism could lead to better the cryogenesis currently used and preserve both model organisms like bacterias and humans from aging.
